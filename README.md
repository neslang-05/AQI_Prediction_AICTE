# AQI Prediction - AICTE

This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning techniques. The repository is designed to help analyze data related to air quality and build predictive models for AQI based on various environmental factors.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict AQI from given environmental data.
- **Approach:** Data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling using Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Technologies:** Python (Jupyter Notebook), data science libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib).

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Implementation of various regression models
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Recommended: Create a virtual environment

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neslang-05/AQI_Prediction_AICTE.git
   cd AQI_Prediction_AICTE
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Notebooks

Open Jupyter Notebook and run the provided notebooks step by step:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Dataset files (if included)
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and modeling
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Usage

1. Download or prepare your AQI/environmental dataset.
2. Follow the notebooks for data analysis and model building.
3. Adjust the code or models as needed to fit your dataset or requirements.
